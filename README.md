# Replication and Extension of “Why Friends and Neighbors? Explaining the Electoral Appeal of Local Roots”

This is the final paper for Government 1006 at Harvard College taken in the spring of 2020. 

### Abstract

\textit{Why Friends and Neighbors? Explaining the Electoral Appeal of Local Roots} by Rosie Campbell, Philip Cowley, Nick Vivyan, and Markus Wagner in the \textit{The Journal of Politics} (Campbell et al. (2019)) details two separate studies which bolster the cue based hypothesis of local roots. I successfully replicated all of their results. For my extension, with the first study, I used a Bayesian approach and found a negligible difference but did find heterogeneous effects based upon social class. With the second study, I looked at the interaction between the components and the respondent age groups as well as interaction between the components themselves where I found 18-24 year-olds being less critical of personal views influencing a member of Parliament’s policy than their older counterparts and local roots downplaying the negative impact of the trustee model of representation on voter preference.
